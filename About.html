            <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
            <p>What's up you guys I am Nicole Lim Barcenas <br>a.k.a ole oleng leng .<br> A 20 years old student from University of
              cience and Technology of Southern Philippines.<br>
            I would like to share to you my blog is about my favorites in Disney 
              which are those princesses but before that.<br>

             can say that I am a responsible and<br>  hard-working student.
               Moreover, being a sociable person, I have many friends since I like to
                communicate with people<br> and get to know new <br>interesting individuals. 
                I enjoy my time at school: it is really nice to study, the students are
                 very<br> friendly and ready to help.<br> The cannot but make me want to
                  go there every time.<br> I like to receive and deal with challenging tasks. 
              I am a very enthusiastic student and I think this is a strong point of mine.
              I am a very out-going and spontaneous girl with, in my opinion, a <br>
               sense of humor (awesome loving friends thing I am funny). One thing you should know <br>
               about me is that I am very bashful and shy but as soon as I came out of a shell, I feel
                very confident and comfortable around peers and friends. It is very easy using myself to make <br>
                friends once I break through timid personality barriers but I think you will love learning about me.<br>
                I enjoy humor and the outgoing personalities of cherished friendships and I care strongly about others
                feelings and ideas. Compassion and honesty are really a part of moral book and my close awesome loving
                 friends will argue that is the biggest weakness<br>
                on mine. I know some people fake their way through
               school and life but you get the real me every day .Academics are a strong 
              point of who I am and I really like school to<br>
             be challenged mentally and physically as well as problem solving. 
               Classes in school come easy most of the time but<br> I really like history 
            and past events which lead to critically thinking every day. These skills are <br>
             invaluable later on in life throughout<br> school and will prepare myself to learn in 
                college and how to think about future goals and responsibilities.
                It's been a tough transition when classes start and coming to the USA but all the people 
           have been very accommodating. Transitioning from SAS to LHS has been emotionally tough 
          but I hope hearing about my life story over the past years will help you get through the tough times. 
        I hope I get to know all the classmates better and I can share about me, my world outside of the USA and 
           the past and current memories of the awesome loving friends.
